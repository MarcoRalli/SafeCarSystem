# SafeCarSystem

Safe car system is a model that is developed using CNN technologies. It has been created using pretrained VGG16 Neural Network.
Model has been trained with a free available dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data.
Notebook presents the pipeline to create properly the datast and to train the network. Folders that has been used are privete and not accessible, but it is possible to recreate the information starting from the data downloadable on the kaggle web site.

Then there is a simple script that load the model and by using some images, made with the web cam or raspberry cam, is able to understand the driver behavior.
